## Introduction
History speaks for itself: throughout the centuries, humans have encountered new challenges and solving them was part of their daily tasks. Nonetheless, not all challenges were unpredictable or undesirable. Sudoku is known as a great game for being capable of testing our abilities when it comes to problem solving and reasoning thinking. Having said that, the aim of this challenge is very simple: a 9x9 matrix is given, with some values already provided that cannot be changed, and the purpose is to fill the empty boxes with the correct values, from 1 to 9. Those values cannot be repeated either by rows, columns, or boxes, and this is what makes this game so special and interesting. In this project, although sudoku puzzles are mainly solved for leisure by human brains, Genetic Algorithms will provide an efficient and optimized way of resolving them.
